# AI and VR Workshops

## About

This website contains all of the resources for the 2019 CS4S *Creating Artificial Intelligence* and *Creating Virtual Reality* workshops.

If you would like to use any of the workshop materials in your classroom, or if you would like to modify them in any way, you are welcome to do so, provided you acknowledge the original source(s).

These workshops have been developed in a partnership with [Google](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/educator-grants/){: class="text-info" target="_blank"}.

## Creating Artificial Intelligence Workshop

The [Creating Artificial Intelligence Workshop](ai/){: class="text-info" } aims to be a practical and accessible introduction to *Machine Learning* (a topic within *Artificial Intelligence*). In the workshop, we will use the free [Machine Learning for Kids website](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/){: class="text-info" target="_blank"}, which does not require any prior knowledge of *Machine Learning* or AI. 

In this workshop, you will learn about:

- the types of problems that *Machine Learning* can solve
- the essential steps in the development of *Machine Learning* solutions
- how the data that we use to 'teach' a computer can impact how a computer 'learns'. 

Some prior experience with coding is assumed but you can participate in the workshop if you only have had experience with blocks languages (like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu){: class="text-info" target="_blank" }) because the resources we use (*Machine Learning for Kids*) use *Scratch* for the coding components.

## Creating Virtual Reality Workshop

The VR workshop will focus on creating scenes in VR with [A-Frame VR](https://aframe.io/){: class="text-info" target="_blank" }, which is a free tool for creating VR scenes using web technologies (HTML and *JavaScript*). In this workshop, you will learn:

- the essential VR concepts
- the differences between commonly available VR headsets 
- how to create and share VR scenes with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/){: class="text-info" target="_blank" } 

The workshop will be best suited to teachers that have some prior experience with web development technologies (particularly HTML).

## Future CS4S Events

We will hopefully run more professional development opportunities next year.
If you are interested in keeping up-to-date with the opportunities that the CS4S team offers, [please register for the UON CS4S mailing list by completing this form](https://goo.gl/forms/uhFt9j740ELhKKxK2){: class="text-info" target="_blank"}.
