# Coding & STEM 4 Schools

## 2019 AI Workshop

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

#### Presented by Mr Daniel Hickmott on 12th November 2019

---

# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is part of our daily lives
- What are some examples of AI that you use or are impacted by?

---

# Defining AI

- The ability for a computer to perform human-like thought processes, ["...such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience"](https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence)
- AI is a very large topic - includes philosophy, ethics, AI algorithms...
- Different approaches (e.g. simulating how a human brain works vs more 'traditional' statistical techniques)

---

# Four Types of AI

- [Four types of AI](https://theconversation.com/understanding-the-four-types-of-ai-from-reactive-robots-to-self-aware-beings-67616), categorised as *Narrow AI* or *General AI*:
	- *Narrow AI:* Reactive Machines, Limited Memory
	- *General AI:* Theory of Mind, Self-Awareness
- *General AI* does not exist yet! (except in movies)
- Most AI that we encounter is *Narrow AI* (solves specific problems, e.g. a chess playing AI)

---

# Why Teach AI?

- Similar reasons for teaching coding to everyone:
	- Jobs (impact of automation)
	- AI Literacy	 
	- Understanding their world
	- Broadening participation
- In curriculum?

---

# AI in Curriculum: Primary

- Not specifically in K-6 syllabuses
- *ICT Capability* (e.g. creating with ICT)
- *Ethical Understanding* (e.g. understanding ethical concepts and issues that relate to AI)
- *Digital Technologies* in *Science and Technology K-6* (e.g. ST3-2DP-T: plans and uses materials, tools and equipment to develop solutions for a need or opportunity) 

---

# AI in Curriculum: Secondary

- *Digital Technologies* in *Technology Mandatory 7-8* (e.g. TE4-1DP designs, communicates and evaluates innovative ideas and creative solutions to authentic problems or opportunities)
- Draft syllabus for *Integrated Computing 7-10* includes AI content, e.g.'explore how artificial intelligence is used to predict patterns of behaviour'
- Draft syllabus for *Software Engineering* includes AI content, e.g. 'develop algorithms that describe artificial neural networks'

---

# Resources for Teaching AI

- Likely that AI will have to be taught to some students in the near future
- There's arguments for teaching AI to every student
- How can we give students an accessible and practical introduction to creating AI?
- Our view was that there was not much out there about AI projects for students
- Luckily, [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/) exists!

# Machine Learning (ML)

- A big topic in itself, encompassing a variety of tools and techniques
- Focused on computers 'learning' from data
- Common methods of ML involve 'training' a model by giving it examples
- Can you think of where ML might be used?


--- 

# Detecting Spam: Coding vs ML

- Usually when coding we break down a problem into steps and rules
- We could come up with some rules to detect spam
- Where does the email come from? 
- It could be spam if it's from Nigeria
- What if our friend is staying in Nigeria?
- We could mark emails from Nigeria that mention money as spam

# Models

- A representation of a real world phenomenon, which we could use for explanation or prediction
- Engineering models (e.g. constructing buildings)
- Financial models
- Statistical models[^1]
- We gather 'real world' data and define variables that 'model' a phenomenon

[^1]: Andy Field's Discovering Statistics Using SPSS explains these really well
