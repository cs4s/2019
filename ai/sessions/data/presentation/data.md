## 2019 AI Workshop

### Representing and Collecting Data

#### Presented by Mr Daniel Hickmott on 12th November 2019

# Modelling a Solution

- When using Machine Learning, it is important to have:
	- An understanding of the appropriate data to collect
	- A variety of examples, including 'unusual' examples
- Having lots of data (examples) can be helpful too

---

# Collecting the Appropriate Data

- We train Machine Learning models with *observations* (a data point - an album)
- These *observations* have different *attributes* (e.g. number of sales of an album)
- The *attributes* should some impact on the studied outcome (usually established through previous research)
- Bad example: [Ice Cream Sales linked to Drowning Deaths](https://www.lifehack.org/624604/the-most-common-bias-people-have-that-leads-to-wrong-decisions)

---

# Identifying Attributes

- Can you think of other *attributes* for predicting album sales?
- Spend on advertising could have an impact on sales but there could be other factors


---

# Collecting a Variety of Examples

- A wide variety of examples can improve our Machine Learning models' accuracy
- Like a survey, we want to collect data from a representative sample (e.g. across ages, genders, income)
- A model that is trained on images could need a variety of images in a variety of lighting conditions
	- Mistakes could be made, e.g. small dogs recognised as cats

# Data for Student Projects

- Students could create data (text, sounds, images)
- Could use surveys (which we will do later)
- Publicly available data (e.g. [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/))
- Could reach out to researchers (maybe?)
- Sample datasets in ML for Kids
- Could use hypothetical examples - without actually gathering data and training models

# Hypothetical Example: Coffee Shop

- You own a coffee shop in a busy part of the city
- Your goal is to identify segments of customers (groups of 'similar' customers)
- The segmentation of customers involves an 'unsupervised learning' technique called *clustering*
- Once you have the clusters you will develop targeted strategies to try to increase sales

---

# Coffee Shop: Data to Collect

- Imagine that you can collect pretty much any information about the coffee shop's customers
- What *attributes* would you collect to use for grouping together 'similar'customers?
- Once you had these clusters, what strategies could you use to upsell to these customers?
