# VR Workshop

## About

*Virtual Reality* (VR) devices are becoming cheaper and more accessible. 
Software for content creation in VR is also becoming more common and there many opportunities for students to immerses themselves in educational experiences using VR. 
Through VR, you can travel around the world without leaving your home, experience historical events as if you were there when they happened, or practice practical skills (such as medical procedures) through hands-on simulations.

This workshop will focus on creating scenes in VR with a free tool, called [A-Frame VR](https://aframe.io){: class="text-info" target="_blank" }. 
*A-Frame* is a WebVR framework, which means you can use Web technologies (HTML and *JavaScript*) for creating VR scenes with *A-Frame*. 
We have chosen to use *A-Frame* because it is free (and always will be) and the project is non-commercial. 
The scenes created with *A-Frame* are easy to share and publish online and the scenes will work across multiple devices, including computers, smartphones and the high-end VR headsets (like the *Oculus Quest* and *HTC Vive*). 

## Activities

The workshop will be run as a practical and hands-on workshop.
